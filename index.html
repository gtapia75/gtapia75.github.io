        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm Gerardo Tapia, a Technical Program Manager who believes in the power of servant leadership and building strong, empowered teams. Throughout my career in the media and entertainment industry, I've led complex data engineering initiatives and digital transformations, but what truly drives me is helping others succeed. I'm known for my calm approach to problem-solving and my ability to bring people together, whether it's resolving technical challenges or fostering collaboration across teams.</p>
        <p>Beyond my professional life, I'm a dedicated family man and an avid sports enthusiast. I hold a black belt in Karate-do, and my passion for athletics has led me to complete six marathons, including the Los Angeles Marathon in 2023. When I'm not working or running, you can find me enjoying time with my wife and two teenagers, tinkering with RC helicopters and cars, or solving puzzles. This balance of technical expertise, physical activity, and family time keeps me grounded and energized to take on new challenges.</p>

                <h3>Enterprise Customer Data Platform (CDP) transformation</h3>
                <p>Led a transformative multi-year initiative to implement a Customer Data Platform across MotorTrend's digital ecosystem, integrating eight different technology platforms. This complex project involved managing 1,500+ development tickets and coordinating efforts across multiple teams including Data Engineering, Product, and QA. To accelerate delivery, I introduced innovative "Situation Rooms" - focused virtual sessions that doubled our ticket resolution speed, enabling us to resolve 20 tickets per half-day session compared to the usual 10 tickets over a two-week sprint. The CDP implementation resulted in $750K in cost savings and significantly improved our ability to understand and serve our users through unified customer data. This project was particularly notable as one of the first large-scale CDP implementations within Warner Bros. Discovery, setting a standard for future data platform integrations.</p>

                <h3>Data Engineering Team Transformation & Agile Implementation</h3>
                <p>When I inherited an unstructured Data Engineering team at MotorTrend, I led a complete cultural and operational transformation by introducing Scrum methodology and data-driven practices. By shifting from reactive maintenance to a proactively planned workflow, we revolutionized how the team operated. I established structured product backlogs, implemented stakeholder-driven prioritization, and created custom analytics dashboards to track team performance. The results were remarkable: the team achieved 50% more story points, 37% higher ticket completion rates, and significantly improved delivery predictability. But beyond the metrics, the real success was seeing team members grow from feeling overwhelmed to becoming confident, collaborative engineers who took ownership of their work. This transformation not only improved our technical delivery but also created a positive, engaging work environment where innovation could thrive.</p>

                <h3>Crackle SVOD Platform Launch - Latin America</h3>
                <p>Led the ambitious expansion of Sony's Crackle streaming service across Latin America, successfully launching the platform in 17 countries while managing technical integrations for 65 different affiliates. This complex project required orchestrating multiple platform types including OTT (Over-The-Top), TVE (TV Everywhere), and STB (Set-Top Box) solutions. I built and led a local QA team in Mexico, implementing Agile methodologies that improved content certification speed by 50% while maintaining 99.9% accuracy. A key innovation was the development of a centralized content delivery hub that served 7 regions (including LATAM, Brazil, and others), which reduced content delivery time by 40% and improved team velocity by 35%. This successful launch earned me the Sony Crackle Employee Award in 2017, recognizing the project's impact on Sony's streaming presence in the region.</p>

                <h3>Enterprise Digital Transformation at Sears Mexico</h3>
                <p>As Head of IT Merchandise at Sears Mexico, I led a major digital transformation initiative that revolutionized how the company managed its purchasing and inventory operations. I architected and deployed an enterprise purchasing platform that served over 500 users and connected with 200+ vendors across 100+ stores. The new system integrated legacy infrastructure with modern platforms, enabling real-time inventory tracking and automated vendor management. Key achievements included a 40% reduction in processing time for purchasing operations and a 45% reduction in transaction processing costs. Leading a team of 5 specialized engineers, we successfully modernized the entire supply chain technology stack while ensuring zero disruption to daily retail operations.</p>
